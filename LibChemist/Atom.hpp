/*! \brief A center in a system
 *
 * An atom is basically just a collection of data associated with a point in
 * space.  Thus most of the get/set operations are trivial and we have made
 * those data members public to avoid a large number of get/set member
 * functions.  At the moment, the only non-trivial get/set is for
 * the basis set.  For the basis we have provided the add_shell/get_basis
 * member functions for setting and getting repsecitively.  These two functions
 * work asymmetrically in that add puts on a shell and get returns all shells.
 * This asymmetry mirrors actual workflows in which there was never any reason
 * to retrieve an individual shell; however, there are scenarios in which
 * individual shells are added.  Individual shells can be retrieved, if needed,
 * from the BasisSet instance.
 *
 * Another highlight of this class is that  many values which are traditionally
 * integers are instead represented as doubles, which allows for fractional
 * occupation, fractional nuclear charge, etc.
 *
 * \note The `create_atom` free functions that follow this class are the
 * intended way to create instances of this class. These free
 * functions, rely heavily on the information contained in the look up tables
 * located in the lut directory.  The reliance on such information is the
 * reason these functions are seperate as it allows us to decouple the physical
 * data from the class.
