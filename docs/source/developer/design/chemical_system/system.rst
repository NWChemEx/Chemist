Chemical System Design

The purpose of this page is to collect notes pertaining to the design of the
``ChemicalSystem`` class and its affiliated classes.

**************************
What is a Chemical System?
**************************

Many quantum chemistry codes talk about the "molecule" as being the input to
the code; however, in chemistry, molecules are simply sets of atoms. Even with
the general definition adopted in :ref:`md_what_is_a_molecule` there are often
additional parts to the system being studied -- for example external fields --
that are not captured by the "molecule" concept. We define the chemical system
to be the entire system we are trying to model. This will almost always
include a molecule.

*************************************
Chemical System Design Considerations
*************************************

.. _cs_molecule:

Molecule
   Following usual quantum chemistry conventions we define the molecule as all
   the atoms in the system, whether they are covalently bonded or not. In this
   sense a molecule is just a set of atoms. The molecule should describe the
   properties of the nuclei and the electrons comprising it.

.. _cs_periodic:

Periodicity
   Periodic molecules (in the :ref:`cs_molecule` sense of the word) require
   one to specify the molecule (again in the :ref:`cs_molecule` sense) which
   forms the unit cell's contents, as well as the shape of the unit cell.

.. _cs_fields:

Fields
   Rather than explicitly model the environment a molecular system is embedded
   in, we often treat that environment via a field. Important examples include:

   - Electric field, from say point charges
   - Magnetic field, from say an NMR experiment
   - Polarizable continuum, from PCM

Out of Scope Considerations
===========================

The considerations in this section were considered in the design, but ultimately
ignored or thought to be better addressed by another component.

Model parameters
   In many cases it is a fine-line between model parameters and the system
   being modeled. Generally speaking we prefer to treat model parameters
   separate from the chemical system when they can be clearly distinguished.
   Of note the AO basis set is considered separately.
