/** @brief Represents a set of atoms.
 *
 *  When atoms come together they become a molecule. Within the Born-Oppenheimer
 *  picture of quantum chemistry, the nuclei of the molecule remain as distinct
 *  points, but the electrons delocalize across multiple atoms. The point is,
 *  that once atoms have been combined to form a molecule we can no longer, in
 *  general, associate electrons with a specific atom. This class models this
 *  by having Atom instances be the inputs, but users of the Molecule can only
 *  get back Nucleus instances or total electronic properties (charge and
 *  multiplicity).
 *
 *  @note While our approach of "dissolving" the atoms upon insertion may be
 *        atypical, note that this is entirely consistent with traditional
 *        inputs (charge, multiplicity, nuclear identities, and Cartesian
 *        coordinates of the nuclei).
