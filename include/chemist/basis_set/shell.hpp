/** @brief Models a set of AOs with a common center, the same total angular
 *         momentum, and the same contracted Gaussian function.
 *
 *  Each Cartesian AO is made up of the product of a contracted Gaussian
 *  function  and a term of the
 *  form: @f$x^ay^bz^c@f$ such that @f$a+b+c = \ell@f$ (with @f$\ell@f$ being
 *  the total angular momentum of the AO. Spherical AOs are then formed by
 *  taking linear combinations of Cartesian AOs (the coefficients of the
 *  transformation being given by the spherical transform). Historically, in
 *  electronic structure theory we implicitly store much of this information in
 *  what is called a shell. A shell is comprised of a contracted Gaussian
 *  function, the total angular momentum, and
 *  whether the AOs in the shell are Cartesian or spherical (often als called
 *  pure). All other information is stored implicitly. At present, this class
 *  adheres to this convention.
 *
 *  @tparam CGType The type of the contracted Gaussian common to all AOs in the
 *                 shell.
