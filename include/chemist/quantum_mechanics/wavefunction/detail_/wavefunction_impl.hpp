/** @brief Code factorization for implementing Wavefunction's virtual methods.
 *
 *  @tparam DerivedType The type of the derived class *this is implementing.
 *
 *  A number of the virtual functions of the Wavefunction class can be
 *  implemented by making some basic assumptions about the derived class
 *  including:
 *   - Defines a copy ctor
 *   - is value comparable
 *  and by knowing the type of the derived class. The Wavefunction Impl class
 *  is code factorization for implementing the virtual functions which fall
 *  into this category.
