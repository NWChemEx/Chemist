Design of the BraKet Component
##############################

This is a collection of notes on the design of the classes for the BraKet
component and should be formalized at some point.

- In prototyping ``BraKet`` and ``TensorRepresentation`` were property types;
  however, this was burdensome when vector spaces/wavefunctions exhibited
  inheritance, e.g., if x inherits from y, then the property type
  ``BraKet<y, Kinetic<Electron>, y>`` was different from
  ``BraKet<x, Kinetic<Electron>, x>``. Moreover because the latter property
  type did not inherit from the former, implicit conversion could not happen.
  With ``BraKet`` (and ``TensorRepresentation``) being traditional classes we
  can define our own implicit conversions easily.
- Rigorously kets are vectors and bras are operations which project onto a
  vector.
- The "projection" part of the bra involves antilinear projection on to a
  vector. In practice, bras are labeled with the complex conjugate of the
  vector they project on to, i.e., if u is the complex conjugate of v than the
  bra which projects on to u is actually labeled v.

   - The points here being: one, we don't expect the user to specify the
     projection, it's implied, and two based on the labeling convention we need
     to internally take the complex conjugate of whatever the user gives us.

- Following from the last points a bra-ket is rigorously a scalar; however,
  since this scalar is a tensor element it is also common to represent the
  entire tensor by specifying a generic element of the tensor in bra-ket form.

   - Think of :math:`\textbf{A}=\braket{i\mid A\mid j}` as the analog of
     :math:`\textbf{A} = a_{ij}`.
   - From a design standpoint this means we want to be able to specify both an
     entire tensor and a tensor element with bra-ket objects. The two are
     distinguished based on whether the usr provides a specific vector or a
     generic vector (which we represent by the entire vector space it can stand
     for).

      - We have separate base classes for Wavefunction and VectorSpace. Should
        we have separate base classes for scalar vs tensor BraKets?

        - Users likely will expect "Wavefunction, Operator, Wavefunction" to
          evaluate to a scalar (or vector depending on the operator) and
          "VectorSpace, Operator, VectorSpace" to evaluate to a
          tensor.
        - Define ``TensorRepresentation`` for ``BraKet`` that evaluate to
          tensors and ``TensorElement`` for ``BraKet`` that evaluate to an
          element of the tensor.
        - Factor out common implementations into ``BraKetBase``.

- ``TensorRepresentation`` and ``TensorElement`` can be used to write generic
  drivers.

- Eventually ``BraKet`` should rely on a PIMPL to hold the state. PIMPLs can be
  used to optimize storage, e.g., only store the bra or the ket if its symmetric
- We probably will need ``BraKetView`` to allow existing state to be used as if
  it were a ``BraKet`` without copying it.
